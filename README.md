# Armethyst
A simple ARM simulator for teaching purposes.

# Repository version control
Every semester new students are enrolled in the course of Computer Architecture I at University of Lavras. Such students may be in contact with GitHub for the first time. Since version control is a subject out of the scope of the course, we adopt the following roles for this repository:

1. The repository is public and accepts fork
2. Each class offer must be identified by an ID with the following template: *turmaYYYYS_CCC*, where YYYY is the four digit year, S is the semester in the year (1 or 2) and CCC is a 3-character code for the class. As example, *turma20201_10A* is for class 10A in the first semester of 2020, and *turma20202_22A* is for class 22A in the second semester of 2020.
3. For each class offer, a branch is created, whose name is the ID of the class offer. Every class offer has the purpose to evolve **armethyst** by executing incremental activities to its implementation.
4. The students must organize themselves in teams, and each team will fork this repository and work on its class offer's respective branch.
